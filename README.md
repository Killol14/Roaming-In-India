# Roaming-In-India


## Milestone Project 3 

 
![Website overlook](assets/images/images/README.img/KS.png)


This website is for people who want to find about more about travelling to India, with tips and ideas for other travellers. 
The user can log and log out, add and amend different categories such as places to visit, travel tips, transport and more. I created this website as I found there were no forums to consolidate different peoples advice, about what they found best when travelling through India.

## Design 
With the user in mind, I wanted to create a website that travellers can easily search, add and amend different activities and tips about travelling to India. I used a simplisitic style with cards that show pictures of the place visited, and also drop down menu where the user can add into the specific category. 

 

## Colour Scheme  

 

I chose this colour scheme, as the website is based around Indian culture and colour scheme of the flag. The Orange and beige orangered colour scheme match with the Indian flag as well as the Olive colours also.   

* Black
* Olive
* FF0000
* FF4500
* CFB21F
* 9ACD32

## Images  

As this website is based on India, I have included images of the country in order to show the diverse aesthetic of India.  

The front page has a background hero image of the Taj Mahal, with CSS automation banner text, with the most visited places showing. I have included these as a stricking image to encourage the reader to click further down on the website to learn more about India. 

The website contains border radius throughout for the images to make them more striking and visually appealing 

I have also added a link to a gallery section, in order to give the reader more of an idea of the beauty of the India.   

There is also a map with significant locations highlited, on the bottom of the website. This is intended the show the diversness of India as it show the most visited places and how the are all spaced out throughout the country. 

 

## Icons  

I used the social media on the footer Icons, which are located on the footer from, Font Awesome.  

 

## Structure  

 

### Navigation Bar  

The navigation bar is Static, so the user can refer back to the links at the top at any point. I have also inlcuded a heartbeat text for Namaste India for added effect. 

I have added the navigation bar on the all other pages so its easy to navigate.



### Hyperlinks  

I have included Hyperlinks on the webpage to allow the user to go straight to different websites where external companies provide more details about India to get more information.  The hyperlinks are located on the Home page, through the booking site booking, the about page through the tips and advice button and the package page, through the destinations button. 

### Map  

I have included a Map, for information on locations and also to show the scale of India.  To createthe map with the most visited places in India Pinpoints, I have used API JavaScript and Markerclusterer

#### LightHouse Images

Gallery Is created with LightHouse-plus-Jquery.js 
LightHouse-plus-Jquery.js Is copied and pasted from zip link Rokesh repository on git hub

### Social Media Links (Footer) 

This includes the icons which take the user to the relevant social media page  

I have added social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin and Twitter. Every page has a social media link at the bottom, excluding the gallery page. 
## Features  
### Current Features  

I have created a website that is fully responsive on all screen sizes eg Tablet Mobile Laptop, by using the Media query and meta view port. This allows the texts and images to translate properly on these devices.  
### Interactive Elements  

I have included a click function that allows the user to open a larger version of the picture. I have also added arrow buttons so that the user can scroll through diffrent Pictures. This is located in the gallery.

## Summary 

This website was created as, I noticed when researching ideas for this project, that there was no specific website dedicated to families and first time travellers to India. I wanted to create a website that was inclusive of all of the needs of the demographic in order to give an opportunity to showcase all the wonderful places India has to offer.  

I believe I have a created a website that shows the natural beauty of India, with stunning visual imagery and links to informative information.
